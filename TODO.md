## ToDo

1. Create a sample output file with data from the first record of sample_output.xml file.
2. Lookup for any exisiting python libraries that can convert xml format to MODSXML format. 
3. Understand the <record> element format in the SOAP Envelope
4. Understand the MODSXML format
5. Map the fields in SOAP Envelop to that of MODSXML
6. Try to reuse existing code and develop a python module that consumes exisiting soap envelope and emits a MODSXML output. Refer XML Schema document of MODSXML at http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-4.xsd.
7. Verify by passing the generated file as input to the xml2bib util tool. Done.
